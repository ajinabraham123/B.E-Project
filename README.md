# B.E-Project

Effcient automation and precise object detection have been an im-
portant advancement of computer vision systems. With the increase
in demand for deep learning techniques, the accuracy for object de-
tection has increased periodically. Our project aims to incorporate
the existing technique for object detection to achieve library automa-
tion with high accuracy with real-time performance and also interfac-
ing it with the application of IoT. A major challenge in our project is
computational hardware, which leads to slow and non-optimal per-
formance. In this project, we use a completely deep learning-based
approach to solve the problem of object detection in an end-to-end
fashion and as a result, we can automate the library using the fol-
lowing technique with the help of solid-state relay. The network is
trained on 500 images to generate its custom weights using darknet.
The resulting system is fast and accurate, thus making 
our system one of the best solutions to modern-day automation.

There are 3 files in the repository. 
1) BE Project files include the automation of lights and fans inside the library using Computer Vision technique.
2) Final Code file has the code of tracking and counting the number of people getting in and out inside the library using centroid tracking.
3) Has some test output video.
